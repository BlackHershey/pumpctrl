There is a trick to install the Java Communications API correctly on a Windows system Machine. The following files are the core of JAVA Communiccation API, and they are very important to have them installed on your system for a proper operation:

comm.jar
win32com.dll
javax.comm.properties
For the jdk (Java Developnment Kit) to recognize the serial ports on your machine, it is important to properly place these files in the right folders on your local machine :

%Java_HOME% = the location of your jdk directory.
NOTE: Also may need to copy to your actual JRE directories, too.

comm.jar should be placed in:

    %JAVA_HOME%/lib

    %JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/ext
win32com.dll should be placed in:

    %JAVA_HOME%/bin

    %JAVA_HOME%/jre/bin

    %windir%System32
javax.comm.properties should be placed in:

    %JAVA_HOME%/lib

    %JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib
